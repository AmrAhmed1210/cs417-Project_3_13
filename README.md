# 🌿 Plant Leaf Disease Detection

## 1. Project Title
Plant Leaf Disease Detection Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## 2. Overview and Goal

This project aims to use Computer Vision and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically analyze images of plant leaves.

[span_0](start_span)The primary goal is to classify the leaf images into healthy or specific diseased categories, enabling early detection and timely intervention in agriculture[span_0](end_span).

## 3. Core Technology

* Technology: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
* [span_1](start_span)Dataset: Plant Village dataset[span_1](end_span).
* [span_2](start_span)Significance: Supports precision agriculture by providing a rapid and accurate diagnostic tool[span_2](end_span).
